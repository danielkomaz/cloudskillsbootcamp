# Cloud Native DevOps Bootcamp by Cloudskills

In this repository I documented my way through all labs and projects of the [Cloud Native DevOps Bootcamp](https://portal.cloudskills.io/products/cloud-native-devops-bootcamp) provided by [Cloudskills.io](https://cloudskills.io/).  
For some projects I also provided alternate ways of distributing the needed infrastructure.

I structured the repository by week and then by project. Each week is documentd by a single README, which itself will then refer to code in the project folders.
